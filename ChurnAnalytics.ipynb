    "## Churn Case Study - Telecom\n",
    "\n",
    "> I worked for `Comcast Cellular One` out of college (1997-ish) doing churn analytics.  I wasn't good at it and only lasted a few months.  The reason was simple...I could do the math but I couldn't do the _Prescriptive Analytics_.  This is very conversational between business domain experts and data professionals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The telecom industry was a monopoly until 1984 with the divestiture of AT&T.  Never before had customers \"churned\" from one telecom provider to another.  Suddenly, churn analytics was all the rage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you are a telecom company with a historical database of customer metrics including:\n",
    "* their telecom \"usage\"\n",
    "* subscription services (internet, bundled products, online backup, security products)\n",
    "* month-by-month subscriber vs annual contract\n",
    "* an indicator as to whether the customer churned\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEO was looking at a Power BI dashboard and noticed that 1 out of 4 customers leaves after some period of time.  (_Descriptive Analytics_).  This is a big problem when the numbers need to be reported to Wall Street.  The CAC in this industry is also VERY high.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ASK:  Build a model to predict likely churns (_Predictive Analytics_) so that we can work with marketing and the domain experts to determine what some good strategies would be to _minimize_ churn.  (_Prescriptive Analytics_ or _what do we do next?_)\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Process\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need a data set of past customers, with their histories, and a _label_ as to whether they churned.  **This isn't easy and will likely take some time in the real world**.  \n",
    "* Once we talk through the _features_ that are needed we'll have a trained _model_ that will tell us the probability that a customer will churn.  \n",
    "* We want to run that against _current_ customers to identify the potential churners so we can determine how to prevent it. (the _treatment_)\n",
    "* BONUS:  Really advanced companies will constantly \"score\" customers whenever something about those customers changes, in real-time.  This allows those companies to make proactive _treatments_ vs being reactive.  This takes time and requires a lot of Prescriptive Analysis.  \n",
