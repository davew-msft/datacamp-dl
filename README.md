## Abstract

Learn how to think like a data professional - unpack core data jargon, see the data science workflow in action, and see how data can be used to solve business and real-life problems.  

Intended audience:  anyone interested in understanding how to use _data_ to make informed decisions.  


## Content

Traditionally, when IT and data folks talk about "using data to solve business problems", it's usually in the context of building dashboards, modeling data, moving data around the IT ecosystem (known as ETL:  Extract Transform and Loading data), and securing data.  Most data scientists, instead, think more about the PROCESS of problem solving.

## Supplementary Jupyter Notebooks

These are examples that build upon the session today.

Jupyter notebooks are the tool-of-choice that data scientists use to _make data tell a story_.  Jupyter notebooks are designed for anyone to use to solve a business problem.  Are you new to Jupyter and using notebooks to solve problems?  I have an [entire github repository](https://github.com/davew-msft/notebooks-everywhere) dedicated to learning Jupyter notebooks and displaying the power of notebooks to solve problems.
